# 30-days-SQL-challenge-leetcode
Welcome to my **30 Days SQL Challenge**!  

For the next 30 days, I will solve **one SQL problem each day** on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) and document my journey here.  

Each day's folder will contain:
- **Problem** – Screenshot of the question   
- **Note** – Query Solution & Short reflection on what I learned

> **How this works:**  
> Each day, I will add a new folder (`day_XX`) and update this table with a link to that folder.  
> Inside the folder, you will find the problem, solution, and reflection note for that day.

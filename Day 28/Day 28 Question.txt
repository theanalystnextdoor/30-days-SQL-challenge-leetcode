Write a solution to calculate the cumulative salary summary for every employee in a single unified table.

The cumulative salary summary for an employee can be calculated as follows:

For each month that the employee worked, sum up the salaries in that month and the previous two months. This is their 3-month sum for that month. If an employee did not work for the company in previous months, their effective salary for those months is 0.
Do not include the 3-month sum for the most recent month that the employee worked for in the summary.
Do not include the 3-month sum for any month the employee did not work.
Return the result table ordered by id in ascending order. In case of a tie, order it by month in descending order.

The result format is in the following example.
